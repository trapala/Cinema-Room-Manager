## Cinema-Room-Manager
### In this project, I have created an app that helps manage a cinema. The app facilitates ticket sales, checking available seats, and provides sales statistics. I have worked on handling input and output in Java. The implementation involves the use of arrays, functions, loops, and conditional statements to ensure efficient operations. This project enables seamless and intuitive cinema management, delivering a smooth experience for both customers and cinema staff.
